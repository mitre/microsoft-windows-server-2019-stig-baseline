  title "Windows Server 2019 organization created Active Directory
Organizational Unit (OU) objects must have proper access control permissions."
  desc  "When directory service database objects do not have appropriate access
control permissions, it may be possible for malicious users to create, read,
update, or delete the objects and degrade or destroy the integrity of the data.
When the directory service is used for identification, authentication, or
authorization functions, a compromise of the database objects could lead to a
compromise of all systems that rely on the directory service.

    For Active Directory, the OU objects require special attention. In a
distributed administration model (i.e., help desk), OU objects are more likely
to have access permissions changed from the secure defaults. If inappropriate
access permissions are defined for OU objects, it could allow an intruder to
add or delete users in the OU. This could result in unauthorized access to data
or a denial of service (DoS) to authorized users."

    Review the permissions on domain-defined OUs.

    Open \"Active Directory Users and Computers\" (available from various menus
or run \"dsa.msc\").

    Ensure \"Advanced Features\" is selected in the \"View\" menu.

    For each OU that is defined (folder in folder icon) excluding the Domain
Controllers OU:

    Right-click the OU and select \"Properties\".

    Select the \"Security\" tab.

    If the Allow type permissions on the OU are not at least as restrictive as
those below, this is a finding.

    The permissions shown are at the summary level. More detailed permissions
can be viewed by selecting the \"Advanced\" button, the desired Permission
entry, and the \"Edit\" or \"View\" button.

range of permissions and properties and are acceptable for this requirement.

Permissions or Properties, this is a finding.

    ENTERPRISE DOMAIN CONTROLLERS - Read, Special permissions

    If an ISSO-approved distributed administration model (help desk or other
user support staff) is implemented, permissions above Read may be allowed for
groups documented by the ISSO.

    If any OU with improper permissions includes identification or
authentication data (e.g., accounts, passwords, or password hash data) used by
systems to determine access control, the severity is CAT I (e.g., OUs that
include user accounts, including service/application accounts).

    If an OU with improper permissions does not include identification and
authentication data used by systems to determine access control, the severity
is CAT II (e.g., Workstation, Printer OUs)."
