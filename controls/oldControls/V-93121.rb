configured with proper audit settings."
  desc  "When inappropriate audit settings are configured for directory service
database objects, it may be possible for a user or process to update the data
without generating any tracking data. The impact of missing audit data is
related to the type of object. A failure to capture audit data for objects used
by identification, authentication, or authorization functions could degrade or
eliminate the ability to track changes to access policy for systems or data.

    For Active Directory (AD), there are a number of critical object types in
the domain naming context of the AD database for which auditing is essential.
This includes Group Policy objects. Because changes to these objects can
significantly impact access controls or the availability of systems, the
absence of auditing data makes it impossible to identify the source of changes
that impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and
systems throughout an AD domain. The lack of proper auditing can result in
insufficient forensic evidence needed to investigate an incident and prosecute
the intruder."

    Review the auditing configuration for all Group Policy objects.

    Open \"Group Policy Management\" (available from various menus or run
\"gpmc.msc\").

>> Domains >> Domain).

    For each Group Policy object:

    Select the Group Policy object item in the left pane.

    Select the \"Delegation\" tab in the right pane.

    Select the \"Advanced\" button.

    Select the \"Advanced\" button again and then the \"Auditing\" tab.

inclusive as those below, this is a finding:

    Principal - Everyone
    Access - Full Control
    Applies to - This object and all descendant objects or Descendant
groupPolicyContainer objects

    The three Success types listed below are defaults inherited from the Parent
Object. Where Special is listed in the summary screens for Access, detailed
Permissions are provided for reference.

    Type - Success
    Principal - Everyone
    Access - Special (Permissions: Write all properties, Modify permissions;
Properties: all \"Write\" type selected)

    Two instances with the following summary information will be listed:

    Principal - Everyone
