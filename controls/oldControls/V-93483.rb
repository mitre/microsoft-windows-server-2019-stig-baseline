  desc  "A PKI implementation depends on the practices established by the Certificate Authority (CA) to ensure the implementation is secure. Without proper practices, the certificates issued by a CA have limited value in authentication functions. The use of multiple CAs from separate PKI implementations results in interoperability issues. If servers and clients do not have a common set of root CA certificates, they are not able to authenticate each other."

    If the \"Issued By\" field of the PKI certificate being used by the domain controller does not indicate the issuing CA is part of the #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} PKI or an approved ECA, this is a finding.
    If the certificates in use are issued by a CA authorized by the Component's CIO, this is a CAT II finding.
    There are multiple sources from which lists of valid #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} CAs and approved ECAs can be obtained:

    The Global Directory Service (GDS) website provides an online source. The address for this site is https://crl.gds.disa.mil.

    #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} Public Key Enablement (PKE) Engineering Support maintains the InstallRoot utility to manage #{input('org_name')[:acronym]} supported root certificates on Windows computers, which includes a list of authorized CAs. The utility package can be downloaded from the PKI and PKE Tools page on IASE:
