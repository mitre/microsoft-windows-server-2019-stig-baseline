  desc  "Exploit protection enables mitigations against potential threats at
the system and application level.  Several mitigations, including \"Validate
exception chains (SEHOP)\", are enabled by default at the system level. SEHOP

an exception chain during exception dispatch. If this is turned off, Windows

    This is applicable to unclassified systems, for other systems this is NA.

    The default configuration in Exploit Protection is \"On by default\" which
meets this requirement.  The PowerShell query results for this show as
\"NOTSET\".

    Run \"Windows PowerShell\" with elevated privileges (run as administrator).

    Enter \"Get-ProcessMitigation -System\".

    If the status of \"SEHOP: Enable\" is \"OFF\", this is a finding.

    Values that would not be a finding include:

    ON
    NOTSET (Default configuration)

  desc  'fix', "
    Ensure Exploit Protection system-level mitigation, \"Validate exception
chains (SEHOP)\", is turned on. The default configuration in Exploit Protection
is \"On by default\" which meets this requirement.

    Open \"Windows Defender Security Center\".

    Select \"App & browser control\".

    Select \"Exploit protection settings\".

    Under \"System settings\", configure \"Validate exception chains (SEHOP)\"
to \"On by default\" or \"Use default (<On>)\".

    The STIG package includes a DoD EP XML file in the \"Supporting Files\"
folder for configuring application mitigations defined in the STIG.  This can
also be modified to explicitly enforce the system level requirements.  Adding
the following to the XML file will explicitly turn SEHOP on (other system level
EP requirements can be combined under <SystemConfig>):

    <SystemConfig>
      <SEHOP Enable=\"true\"></SEHOP>
    </SystemConfig>

    The XML file is applied with the group policy setting Computer
Configuration >> Administrative Settings >> Windows Components >> Windows
Defender Exploit Guard >> Exploit Protection >> \"Use a common set of exploit
protection settings\" configured to \"Enabled\" with file name and location
defined under \"Options:\". It is recommended the file be in a read-only
network location.
